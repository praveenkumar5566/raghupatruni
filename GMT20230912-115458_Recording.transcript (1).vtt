335
00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:43.910
V Cube Software: And then this can be anything at work. And then Security Group. If you want, you can create our attach. But I don't want to do anything that come down

336
00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:44.980
V Cube Software: and then

337
00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:47.580
V Cube Software: launch

338
00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.480
template.

339
00:38:50.230 --> 00:38:52.080
V Cube Software: So once you launch the template.

340
00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:59.389
V Cube Software: Now to refresh the template name is 5 Vm. Tp. Template, and which another attach this

341
00:38:59.910 --> 00:39:00.950
V Cube Software: default

342
00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:08.279
V Cube Software: click on next. So Vpc. Is already there. So availability zones.

343
00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.640
V Cube Software: So one a and then one b 2 availability zones.

344
00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:15.780
V Cube Software: and then come down. Click on next.

345
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:24.240
V Cube Software: No load balancer, or if you want. You can attach a existing load. Balancer. Our existing load balancer is

346
00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.920
V Cube Software: I'm Yup

347
00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.620
V Cube Software: 5 vm. Tp, 5 vm. Badge

348
00:39:29.040 --> 00:39:30.429
V Cube Software: this. Come down.

349
00:39:33.290 --> 00:39:36.050
V Cube Software: Come down so

350
00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.899
I'll make it as

351
00:39:38.130 --> 00:39:46.640
V Cube Software: 100 s. Health check every 100 s. Key for this, however, health check. We check. Js Kumi. This come down click on next.

352
00:39:47.110 --> 00:39:54.520
V Cube Software: So a crab desired capacity, minimum capacity. Same on Dalai. So any service we took minimum, any service on Dali

353
00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:57.790
V Cube Software: Andy. 3 maximum.

354
00:39:58.670 --> 00:40:02.409
V Cube Software: 7 or 5 5 is good. Number. Okay, 5.

355
00:40:04.150 --> 00:40:09.940
V Cube Software: Sorry minimum is 3 only. And then maximum is 5.

356
00:40:10.470 --> 00:40:12.160
V Cube Software: I'm done.

357
00:40:12.510 --> 00:40:17.059
V Cube Software: Target scaling. Crossing. You put a Scalea valley in purple perigalies.

358
00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:18.510
V Cube Software: If you are

359
00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:26.910
V Cube Software: target tracking policy, average CPU utilization like a third server. CPU utilization.

360
00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:28.909
V Cube Software: 70 crossing, though

361
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:37.970
V Cube Software: 70 s forced our launch hour on.

362
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:40.260
V Cube Software: Then you create just now. Yes.

363
00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.410
V Cube Software: next

364
00:40:43.350 --> 00:40:44.520
V Cube Software: create. Next.

365
00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.719
V Cube Software: come down, create

366
00:40:47.850 --> 00:40:54.420
V Cube Software: correct. So in probably 2 min long again you said about Stal Ali. You've already thrown it.

367
00:40:54.430 --> 00:41:00.350
V Cube Software: Every load balancer. We have only 3 governing minimum reach a maximum 5, which of oxygen

368
00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.410
V Cube Software: wait here.

369
00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:13.399
V Cube Software: The load bands are created in the auto spilling create in the

370
00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:16.049
V Cube Software: so click on auto scaling.

371
00:41:29.090 --> 00:41:30.059
V Cube Software: That's good

372
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.910
V Cube Software: other than the one type, one type, one 1 s.

373
00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:47.249
V Cube Software: So auto scaling create auto spelling. So my iphone 5 Pm.

374
00:41:50.110 --> 00:41:50.980
V Cube Software: oh, no

375
00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:55.800
V Cube Software: autosculic

376
00:41:57.670 --> 00:42:00.990
V Cube Software: if yes. I'm done.

377
00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:04.690
V Cube Software: Launch template 5 PMDP.

378
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:07.179
V Cube Software: Click on next

379
00:42:09.140 --> 00:42:12.290
V Cube Software: availability zone, one a one B,

380
00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.690
next

381
00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:31.050
V Cube Software: more load balancer attached, and to an existing load balancer. and then attach a new load. Balancer. So no load, balancer, no Vpcs. So within 100 s, yes.

382
00:42:33.100 --> 00:42:37.679
V Cube Software: come next design capacity is 3

383
00:42:38.490 --> 00:42:50.980
V Cube Software: Riman 3, and then Maximus. But you're putting this Ali target is if the percentage is more than 70,

384
00:42:51.410 --> 00:42:57.320
V Cube Software: if 70% dollars are 1,000 s from day. It's a warm up.

385
00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.029
V Cube Software: So that's fine. I think you will listen. So create a

386
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:15.519
V Cube Software: next create. Next. can we go check next. can come down.

387
00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.179
V Cube Software: create auto spelling group.

388
00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:25.330
V Cube Software: So you put an auto scaling group created in the improvement, and the same again, easy to install and be des Andi

389
00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:29.659
V Cube Software: minimum. And the maximum and the 5

390
00:43:29.740 --> 00:43:33.869
V Cube Software: April automatic and we have the fee

391
00:43:35.010 --> 00:43:36.100
V Cube Software: any service

392
00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:53.869
V Cube Software: desired and the antenna we call against any maintained memory desired at the tree. So you terminate chase with termite hours already.

393
00:43:54.860 --> 00:43:56.060
V Cube Software: Server one

394
00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.720
V Cube Software: server, and do

395
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:07.270
V Cube Software: 103.

396
00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:10.420
So these are not done by clearly.

397
00:44:10.900 --> 00:44:12.810
V Cube Software: Yes, threeya

398
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:22.649
V Cube Software: instance alumni. It will look for 100 s, and it is immediately going to launch the server.

399
00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:28.639
V Cube Software: So 100 s avalanche

400
00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:39.909
V Cube Software: so, and the game one again. So load balancer number 3, auto scale, only 5. Let's see. Wait for a couple more minutes

401
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:49.259
V Cube Software: 100 s of early.

402
00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:16.660
V Cube Software: So let's are you fish? What Isabella Ranad? Namali? Yes.

403
00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:23.450
V Cube Software: TV auto scaling and then load, embrace them and load automatic a pencil and gravity cooperative picture to load automatic appenching.

404
00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.629
V Cube Software: So load automated penciling numbering, we have to go with

405
00:46:26.830 --> 00:46:28.910
V Cube Software: that many days a day to be checked out.

406
00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:42.389
V Cube Software: So auto scaling, load balance and render, oh, can encounter doubts? And Miko okay, good permanent delivery challenge integranding. Then we'll launch in the auto, scaling auto scaling globally.

407
00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:50.380
V Cube Software: Ikra. My 5 Pm. Is auto spelling Rupander and DC. Deli chaini ikra DLED deliber

408
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:51.660
V Cube Software: click, change it.

409
00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:56.070
V Cube Software: So improve any dashboard that you're running.

410
00:47:02.450 --> 00:47:04.370
V Cube Software: Can you read another name?

411
00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:16.189
V Cube Software: Automated Terminator. Internation abimali Lavinka? Yes, next.

412
00:47:17.060 --> 00:47:19.550
V Cube Software: Lord balance a granting target group and

413
00:47:19.720 --> 00:47:22.739
V Cube Software: target. Group me in subilitating.

414

V Cube Software: Yes, delete.

415
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:28.840
V Cube Software: so Villageailer and the good Lord balance on the governing. So Lord Valenti.

416
00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:35.739
V Cube Software: in the click, chamber load variants are running, actions are running. Then it load balancer and then

417
00:47:37.550 --> 00:47:39.929
V Cube Software: cool icon delete

418
00:47:41.670 --> 00:47:44.969
